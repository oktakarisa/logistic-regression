# Data Directory

This folder is reserved for any external datasets you might want to use.

## Note:
The assignment uses the **Iris dataset** which is built into scikit-learn, so no external data files are required for the basic assignment.

However, you can place additional datasets here if you want to test the model on other binary classification problems.

## Example Usage:
```python
# If you have custom data
import numpy as np
X_custom = np.load('data/your_features.npy')
y_custom = np.load('data/your_labels.npy')
```
