# Plots Directory

This folder contains all visualization outputs generated by the logistic regression implementation.

## Generated Files:
- `learning_curve.png` - Training and validation loss over iterations (Problem 6)
- `decision_boundary.png` - 2D decision boundary visualization (Problem 7)
- `feature_coefficients.png` - Bar plot of learned feature weights

These files are automatically generated when you run `verification.py` or the Jupyter notebook.
